# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app


## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution to the [Tip calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX). 

The challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the given design as possible.
The users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app based on your device's screen size
- View hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and the total cost of the bill per person

I would like to say that I enjoyed it very much.
